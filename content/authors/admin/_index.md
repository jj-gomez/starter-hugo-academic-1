Welcome to my personal webpage! I am a **third-year PhD student** at the Robotics, Perception and Real Time (RoPeRT) group at the University of Zaragoza (Unizar) under the supervision of Prof. Juan D. Tardós. Previously I studied a Bachelors's degree in Computer Sciende and a Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering, both at Unizar where I started my career as a Computer Vision researcher.

My work revolves how computers percieve and understand their suroundings by means of **Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping** techniques (V-SLAM). I am specially interested and motivated by those challenging situations that impairs the use of this technologies like **deformable V-SLAM** which has direct application to many other fields like Minimal Intrusive Surgery.
